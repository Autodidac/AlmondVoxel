# Tooling inventory

Core utilities used to build and validate AlmondVoxel:

- Git – version control and submodule management.
- CMake 3.23+ – project configuration and generation.
- Ninja – preferred generator for fast builds (falls back to Makefiles or MSBuild when unavailable).
- GCC / Clang / MSVC – primary compilers exercised across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- SDL3 – graphics/input dependency for `terrain_demo`.
- Python 3 – ad-hoc scripting and data processing.
- Ccache (Linux/macOS) or `clcache` (Windows) – optional compile caching.
- vcpkg – optional dependency provider on Windows for SDL3 and future adapters.
- Windows Terminal / VS Code / Visual Studio – editors and shells used during development.
